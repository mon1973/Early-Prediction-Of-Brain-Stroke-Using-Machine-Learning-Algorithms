#Early-Prediction-Of-Brain-Stroke-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
ABOUT:
The primary objective is to create an accurate predictive model for identifying stroke risk using machine learning techniques. This model intends to outperform traditional methods and improve early stroke detection.The system analyzes the data, and the data is pre- processed by data pre-processing method. Finally, KNN,Decision Tree, Random Forest,  SVC, Gradient Boost. Classifiers were used to identify brain stroke patients. This research aims to create a system that can predict brain stroke.
