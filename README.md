Early-Prediction-Of-Brain-Stroke-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms


ABOUT:
The primary objective is to create an accurate predictive model for identifying stroke risk using machine learning techniques. This model intends to outperform traditional methods and improve early stroke detection.The system analyzes the data, and the data is pre- processed by data pre-processing method. Finally, KNN,Decision Tree, Random Forest,  SVC, Gradient Boost. Classifiers were used to identify brain stroke patients. This research aims to create a system that can predict brain stroke.

Detection Accuracy: 98%  

Note: 

These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.

Results and Impact:

In comparison to the current system, which requires more time to review the data after the diagnosis process, using this model can forecast and yield the most accurate outcomes.

It is worth noting that some features were found to be less significant compared to others, thereby prompting the researcher to utilize the low ranking feature ranker algorithm. The results of this algorithm demonstrated that two features had a relatively low impact. In order to formulate an effective strategy for quitting smoking, it is strongly recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or physician who can provide valuable guidance and support.
